## About Me



I'm currently a gruated student at China Agricultural University. 
I'm also very fortunate to closely work with Professor [Ju Fan](http://iir.ruc.edu.cn/~fanj) as a research intern.
Previously I interned in the search and recommendation algorithm team at the Poizon Community.
My current research interests include AI4DB, Data Mining.

## Research Interests

- **Recommender Systems (Recsys)**: My research in recommender systems primarily revolves around coarse ranking and fine ranking methodologies. I am particularly interested in developing effective coarse ranking algorithms that can quickly filter large item sets to identify promising candidates.
- **AI for Databases (AI4DB)**: I'm interested in exploring the intersection of artificial intelligence and database management systems. Currently, I am closely collaborating with AWS and MIT CSAIL on the workload synthesis project.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) - Model Quantization**: My research interests include model quantization techniques that enable the deployment of large-scale NLP models on resource-constrained devices. I am exploring methods to reduce the model size and computational requirements while maintaining performance. This includes investigating techniques such as weight pruning, quantization-aware training, and knowledge distillation to create efficient models that can be applied in real-time applications.
